# Travelling Salesman Problem - A Genetic Algorithm Solution

This project attempts to solve the well-known [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) using a Genetic Algorithm.

In summary, the code tries to simulate _natural selectio_ using a specific _mutator_ function.
I.e. each new generation is modelled on the survivors of the last, and each new generation is mutated from the last,
meaning over time in theory the solutions will tend to the perfect solution. A problem with this algorithm is the
"local optima" issue, which you can read more using the following link.
